# Backlinks Tracking Tool

# What are Backlinks?
Backlinks occur when one website links to another website.
Whenever backlinks occur (particularly quality backlinks), it is like receiving "a vote" for a webpage. The more votes you get from sites with authority, the more positive an effect on a siteâ€™s SEO (rankings and search visibility).

# Why Are Backlinks Important?
Backlinks help search engines determine how authoritative and relevant your site is on the keyword or topic for which you rank. Furthermore, backlinks to your website are a signal to search engines that other external websites are endorsing your content.
If many sites link to the same webpage or website, search engines can interpret that that content is worth linking to, and therefore also worth ranking higher on the Google search results page.
